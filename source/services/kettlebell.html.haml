    %p <b>Kettle Bell</b> – Daniel offers private and semi-private training that specializes in Russian-style Kettlebell – a world-class system of strength training.  Yet kettlebell also covers cardio and flexibility, making for a time-saving and highly effective workout.  Daniel understands, though, that physical activity alone will not let you achieve your best body.  Which is why his programs include extensive and individualized nutritional coaching that focuses on gradually improving healthy eating, one habit at a time.
