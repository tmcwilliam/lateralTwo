    %p Whether it’s your first time running a half marathon or competing as an elite triathlete, Lateral Fitness endurance training works in two steps to design a proper program for an athlete: determining how efficient your muscular system is and how strong your energy system is.

    %p The first stage is building your foundation or base by improving your muscular, cardiovascular, and metabolic system.  However, you are only as strong as your weakest link and by addressing your strengths and weaknesses through a segmental process, Lateral Fitness will be able to help you increase your tolerance in running, cycling, and swimming. This also includes looking at your limitations through a segmental asymmetrical approach.. In other words, if your pistons aren’t working efficiently in your car, they will affect the overall performance of your car. Building the foundation is essential to establishing a healthy platform for higher endurance and efficiency.

    %p The second stage is training the energy systems.  Lateral Fitness prepares athletes by block training into more manageable units: quantifying training, setting specific goals, measuring outcomes and allocating time for interaction of different components  for all phases.  With this approach, you then follow a training plan broken into different phases of Periodization:

    %ul.list-items
      %li General Preparatory Phase (Base)
      %li Specific Preparatory Phase (Base 3)
      %li Pre-competative Phase (Build)
      %li Main competition Phase (taper)
      %li Transition Phase
      %li Unloading/Recovery phase

    %p No matter what level athlete you are or when your event may take place, Lateral Fitness can individualize a training program that fits your needs and goals.
