Blog Entry Outline

- Middleman
	- Static site generator popularity. Brief history of how we got here
		"In the early days of web development things were simple. Write some HTML, style it with CSS and you're done. Not only are you done, but you have a static website with great performance. However, that process became rather tedious after repeating it for every page. So PHP became the tool of choice and an introduction to server side technologies. It only seems fitting that we are now through the advancement of browsers we are coming full circle and static sites are becoming popular again."
		"But what about the tedious-ness? Enter Middleman"
	- What you get out of the box
		- Layouts
